int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. savings, with the value 100, is an example of an integer.
float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. factor, with the value 1.10, is an example of a float.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).

More specifically, you'll need str(), to convert a value into a string. str(savings), for example, will convert the float savings to a string.

Similar functions such as int(), float() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type.
example:
In [7]: "The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number " + str(2)
Out[7]: 'The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number 2'
